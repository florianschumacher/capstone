(first, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. then we\u2019ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nquickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. pull it, double it, and twist it again. keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. this is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. embrace the upper body workout. note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\ndon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. when it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. re-oil your bench scraper. take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nonce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. cut each log into four equal pieces. hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\non the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. set the canes aside to cool. (know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nrepeat this process with the remaining 3\/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nallow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. store in an airtight jar for several months.",

(i find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. when doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. this will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. this is also a very important step. if the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nwhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. season with salt. cover generously with flour. it should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\ncrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. the dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. if too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nform the dough into a large log. cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. cut the ropes into 1\/2-inch lengths. cover generously with flour. place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. do not pile on top of each other!!\r\n\r\nuse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. if freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. when cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nnote: it is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. this is a big mistake. gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\np.s. these are chef anne \"secrets\" to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time.\r\n\r\nread more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/anne-burrell\/gnocchi-with-prosciutto-spring-peas-and-chanterelles-recipe\/index.html?oc=linkback",

(if it\u2019s sticking to the grill, it wants to cook longer.) flip pieces over and cook until charred on second side, about 5 to 8 minutes more. set aside to cool slightly then chop into chunks.\r\n\r\nno grill? heat oven to 425. trim eggplant and slice into 1\/2-inch coins. coat a baking sheet generously with olive oil, arrange eggplant on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. roast, without disturbing, for 15 to 20 minutes. carefully flip each piece: the undersides should be blistery, dark and a bit puffy and should release easily; if they don\u2019t want to, cook them a few minutes longer. flip each piece, sprinkle again with salt and pepper, and roast on the second side for 10 to 12 minutes, or until charred underneath again.\r\n\r\nmake dressing: in food processor, coarsely grind walnuts, cheese, garlic, thyme, salt and freshly ground black pepper and\/or red pepper flakes. stir in oil and tomatoes, then whisk in vinegar to taste.\r\n\r\nassemble salad: toss cooked pasta with walnut dressing and additional vinegar and oil to loosen (i used about 1 tablespoon extra oil and 2 tablespoons extra vinegar in total). add eggplant and toss again. adjust seasonings to taste, then stir in cheese and herbs.",

(watch closely as you don't want the cheese to dry out.)\r\n\r\n5. top the salad with the haloumi. sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons mint, and serve right away.\r\n\r\nto get a head start: make the wheat berries, as in step 1, ahead. the salad (without the haloumi) can be prepared 4 to 6 hours ahead. chill, covered. bring to room temperature before serving.",

        "instructions": "for basic tamagoyaki:\r\n\r\n1. mix together all of the tamagoyaki ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy.\r\n\r\n2. heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. if the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. if the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. as soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. if you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. this adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. as soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. as before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. the thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. when the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. cut into even slices before packing. garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. it will still taste great! leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nfor salami and cream cheese rolls:\r\n\r\n1. peel the carrot and cut into strips to same thickness and length as the green beans.\r\n\r\n2. bring a pot or pan of water to a rapid boil. add carrots and green beans, boil for 3-4 minutes until crisp-tender. drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.\r\n\r\n3. on each piece of salami, place a dollop of cream cheese, a green bean, and a stick or two of carrot. roll into a little burrito. (if necessary, cut a toothpick in half and use it to pin the salami closed.)\r\n\r\n4. if you have leftover carrots or green beans, dice them for sprinkling over the rice.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nfor rice:\r\n\r\n1. pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with the excess vegetables.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nfor garlic sauteed spinach:\r\n\r\n1. heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. add the garlic and cook for 30s-1m, until fragrant and infusing the oil.\r\n\r\n2. add the spinach and stir-fry rapidly. it will shrink down in mass in no time. when done, turn off heat, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper, and let cool.\r\n\r\n3. pack into a bento cup for serving.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nto instead prepare as a rice bowl (when you're eating it fresh rather than prepping a bento for later), just put the rice serving in a bowl. fry the eggs, to a soft\/gooey yolk, and put on top of rice. dice the veggies after boiling, add to the spinach during cooking, and put the whole mixture on top of the eggs. finally, large dice the salami and small-cube the cream cheese, and put on top of the bowl.\r\n\r\nif you want a little more kick, add togarashi to the eggs, and\/or drizzle some sriracha or other chili sauce on top of the bowl when done.

(exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nfor the filling\r\n\r\n1. combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nto assemble\r\n\r\n1. butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. gently press the filling into the dough. (if you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nto bake\r\n\r\n1. heat the oven to 200 degrees f.\r\n2. when the oven has reached 200 degrees f, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees f and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees f. remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nfor the icing\r\n\r\n1. whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. add the milk and whisk until combined. sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nnotes\r\n\r\nin case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. to reheat, move to a small plate (i usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nto freeze: individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. when ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. then microwave for 30 seconds.",

(ideally, use an onigirazu mold.)\r\n3. top with tofu, mayo, then veggies, and finally a second layer of rice.\r\n4. fold the nori corners over the stack, using the cling film to help keep it together without tearing, until you get a small packet.\r\n5. finally gather all the cling film over the stack and tie on the top. put something moderately heavy (like a breadboard) on the onigirazu and set it aside to let the seaweed soften a little. cut in half with a sharp knife.",
